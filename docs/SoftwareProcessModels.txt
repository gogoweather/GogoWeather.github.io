--------- Waterfall


pros: 
	- linear sequence, logical order that shows a clear timeline that our team could roughly follow and scaffold productions around
	- easy to plan 

cons: 
	- ideal for large teams: our group only has 4 people.
	- independent: a team would work on their own task with little communication with others. This won't work for us since without communication, our project would fall apart.
	- costly: requires a lot of research and planning that might turn out to be unnecessary to our project.
	- requirements and details need to be finalized before project begins: we can't do this since we are still deciding various features, and expect many changes. 
	- very difficult to backtrack, since details were "finalized" at start of project. 
	- dependence on previous phase: our project might stall if we can't produce the previous part in time.



--------- Agile

pros: 
	- flexible: our team members can work on various parts of the project as they see fit.  
	- communication: since we only have 4 people, our communication can be more open and direct.
	- people based: we can get to know each other's strengths and weaknesses, and help each other improve on various areas.
	- simplicity: focusing on simplicity makes our project much more feasible. 
	

cons: 
	- bugs: might be harder to find and fix
	- missing features: with our current knowledge, we might not be able to add or build certain additional features.
	- understaffed: have to figure out things on your own.
	- optimization might not be priority
